Lab Exercise: Text Classification
Using Newsgroup dataset from scikit-learn train and evaluate Linear SVM (LinearSVC) model
Experiment with different vectorization methods and parameters, experiment_id in parentheses (e.g. CounVector, CutOff, etc.):
    -binary of Count Vectorization (CountVect)
    -TF-IDF Transformation (TF-IDF)
    -Using TF-IDF
        -min and max cut-offs (CutOff)
        -wihtout stop-words (WithoutStopWords)
        -without lowercasing (NoLowercase)
        
To print the results: print(experiment_id, the most appropriate score metric to report)

Note: If the SVM doesn't converge play with the hyperparameter (starting from a low value).
